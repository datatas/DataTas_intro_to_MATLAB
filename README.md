# DataTas_intro_to_MATLAB

Welcome to the DATATAS Introduction to MATLAB course! 
We have supplied some commented scripts designed to be worked through step by step. A good place to 
start is with the script: intro_to_coding.m.
Work your way through cell by cell, and read the comments as you go. 
Once you're happy with the basic data types in MATLAB, have a go at the plotting exercise. Start in 
the script: penguins_plot.m.
This contains a series of commented cells. See if you can fill in the lines of code needed to create 
a plot of the Palmer Penguin data. If you get stuck, take a look at penguins_plot_cheat.m. This has 
the code filled in for you (although you will need to change the file paths). Remember, there is 
more than one way to do almost everything in MATLAB, so different answers are not necessarily wrong. 
Happy coding!
